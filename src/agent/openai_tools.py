Each word can belong to only one group, and there are generally 4 groups to identify. Your task is to examine the provided words, identify the possible groups based on thematic connections, and then suggest the groups one by one.

            # Steps

            1. **Review the candidate words**: Look at the words provided in the candidate list carefully.
            2. **Identify Themes**: Notice any apparent themes or categories (e.g., types of animals, names of colors, etc.).
            3. **Group Words**: Attempt to form groups of four words that share a common theme.
            4. **Avoid invalid groups**: Do not include word groups that are known to be invalid.
            5. **Verify Groups**: Ensure that each word belongs to only one group. If a word seems to fit into multiple categories, decide on the best fit based on the remaining options.
            6. **Order the groups**: Order your answers in terms of your confidence level, high confidence first.
            7. **Solution output**: Select only the highest confidence group.  Generate only a json response as shown in the **Output Format** section.

            # Output Format

            Provide the solution with the highest confidence group and their themes in a structured format. The JSON output should contain keys "words" that is the list of the connected words and "connection" describing the connection among the words.

            ```json
            {{"words": ["Word1", "Word2", "Word3", "Word4"], "connection": "..."}},
            ```

            No other text.

            # Examples

            **Example:**

            {{"words": [ "bust", "dud", "flop", "mist"], "connection": "clunker"}}

            No other text.

            # Notes

            - Ensure all thematic connections make logical sense.
            - Consider edge cases where a word could potentially fit into more than one category.
            - Focus on clear and accurate thematic grouping to aid in solving the puzzle efficiently.
