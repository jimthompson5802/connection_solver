'Exhaust' and 'sap' can both refer to the act of depleting energy or resources, aligning them with the concept of depletion or drainage. However, 'total' refers to the sum or entirety of something, which is a different concept related to completeness or aggregation. Therefore, these words pertain to multiple concepts: depletion and totality.\n"
