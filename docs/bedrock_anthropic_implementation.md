## Successfully solved test puzzle with Anthropic Claude Sonnet v1 LLM
Inserted a bunch of asynio.sleep(8.0) before each call to LLM and converted concurrent processing to sequential processing to avoid the ThrottlingException.

Need to work out a more robust solution for this.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 2
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('kayak', 'level', 'mom')
Connection Description: The words 'kayak', 'level', and 'mom' can be related to a single topic: palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. All three of these words are palindromes:

1. 'kayak' - reads the same from left to right and right to left
2. 'level' - also reads the same in both directions
3. 'mom' - another word that is identical when reversed

The shared context for these words is their linguistic property of being palindromes. This characteristic is a unique and specific feature that connects all three words, despite their different meanings in everyday usage. Therefore, we can confidently say that these words relate to a single topic within the realm of wordplay and linguistics.

>>>One-away group recommendations:
one_away_group_recommendation is a new recommendation
using one_away_group_recommendation

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['kayak', 'level', 'mom', 'racecar'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words "kayak", "level", and "mom" is that they are all palindromes - words that read the same forwards and backwards. Among the candidate words, "racecar" is the only palindrome, making it the most highly connected to the anchor words. The other candidate words do not share this unique characteristic.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 4
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('level', 'return', 'tab')
Connection Description: The words 'level', 'return', and 'tab' can be related to a single topic: computer keyboard or typing. Here's how they are connected:

1. Level: On a keyboard, the 'Caps Lock' key is often referred to as a 'level' shift key, changing the input level from lowercase to uppercase.

2. Return: The 'Return' key, also known as 'Enter', is a standard key on computer keyboards used to start a new line or submit input.

3. Tab: The 'Tab' key is another common key on keyboards, used for indentation or moving between fields in forms.

All three words refer to keys or functions commonly found on computer keyboards, thus they can be related to the single topic of computer input devices or typing interfaces. This connection demonstrates how these seemingly disparate words can be unified under a common theme in the context of modern technology and text input methods.

EMBEDVEC_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['level', 'level', 'return', 'tab'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words "level", "return", and "tab" is that they are all palindromes - words that read the same forwards and backwards. From the candidate words, "level" is the most highly connected to the anchor words because it is also a palindrome, sharing this unique linguistic property with all the anchor words.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 2
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('kayak', 'level', 'mom')
Connection Description: The three words "kayak", "level", and "mom" can be related to a single topic: palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. All three words given are examples of palindromes:

1. "kayak" - spelled the same forwards and backwards
2. "level" - also spelled the same forwards and backwards
3. "mom" - a shorter palindrome, but still reads the same in both directions

The shared context for these words is their linguistic property of being palindromes, which is a specific characteristic in the English language. This makes them all examples of the same concept in language and word play, thus allowing them to be related to a single topic.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 3
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('kayak', 'level', 'tab')
Connection Description: The words 'kayak', 'level', and 'tab' can be related to a single topic: palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. 

1. 'Kayak' is a palindrome word, spelled the same forwards and backwards.
2. 'Level' is also a palindrome word.
3. While 'tab' itself is not a palindrome, it can become one when reversed: 'tab' becomes 'bat'.

All three words have a strong connection to the concept of palindromes in language and wordplay. 'Kayak' and 'level' are classic examples of palindromes, while 'tab' demonstrates how some words can be transformed into palindromes by reversal. This shared characteristic of symmetry and reversibility in language unites these three words under the single topic of palindromes.

>>>One-away group recommendations:
one_away_group_recommendation is a new recommendation
using one_away_group_recommendation

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['kayak', 'level', 'racecar', 'tab'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words (kayak, level, tab) is that they are all palindromes - words that read the same forwards and backwards. Among the candidate words, 'racecar' is the only palindrome, making it the most highly connected to the anchor words. The other candidate words do not share this distinctive characteristic with the anchor words.
Recommendation ['kayak', 'level', 'racecar', 'tab'] is incorrect, one away from correct

Connection Description: The words 'kayak', 'level', and 'tab' can be related to a single topic: palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. 

1. 'Kayak' is a palindrome word, spelled the same forwards and backwards.
2. 'Level' is also a palindrome word.
3. While 'tab' itself is not a palindrome, it can become one when reversed: 'tab' becomes 'bat'. This property is called a semordnilap (palindromes spelled backwards).

All three words have a strong connection to the concept of palindromes or reversible words, which is a specific linguistic feature. Therefore, they can be related to the single topic of palindromes or word play in the English language.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('beginner', 'open', 'receptive')
Connection Description: The words 'beginner', 'open', and 'receptive' can be related to a single topic: Learning or New Experiences. Here's how they connect:

1. Beginner: This word directly relates to someone who is new to a skill, subject, or experience.

2. Open: In the context of learning or new experiences, being 'open' suggests a willingness to try new things or accept new ideas.

3. Receptive: This term implies being ready and willing to receive new information or experiences.

All three words share a common context of approaching new knowledge or experiences with a positive, accepting attitude. They describe qualities that are beneficial for someone embarking on a learning journey or facing new situations. 

The single topic that encompasses all three words could be described as "The Ideal Learner's Mindset" or "Attributes for Embracing New Experiences." Each word represents a key aspect of this mindset: being new to something (beginner), willing to engage with it (open), and ready to take in new information or experiences (receptive).

1. Chalk is used to apply to the tip of the cue stick to increase friction and prevent miscues.
2. Pockets are the holes on the table where balls are sunk.
3. Rack is both a noun (the triangular frame used to arrange the balls at the start of the game) and a verb (the act of setting up the balls).

All three words are essential elements or actions in the game of billiards/pool, thus they can be connected under this single topic.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 4
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('speak', 'voice', 'vote')
Connection Description: The words 'speak', 'voice', and 'vote' can all be related to a single topic: expression of opinion or participation in democracy.

Common contexts for each word:
1. Speak: to utter words, to express oneself, to address an audience
2. Voice: the sound produced by vocal cords, to express an opinion, to articulate thoughts
3. Vote: to express a choice in an election, to make a decision as part of a group

Shared context:
All three words relate to the concept of expressing oneself or participating in a democratic process. 

- 'Speak' can refer to voicing one's thoughts or opinions.
- 'Voice' can be used both literally (as in speaking) and figuratively (as in expressing one's views).
- 'Vote' is a way of expressing one's choice or opinion in a formal decision-making process.

These words converge on the theme of civic engagement and the expression of individual or collective will in a democratic society. They all involve the act of making one's thoughts, opinions, or choices known, whether through verbal communication or formal political processes.

Therefore, these three words can be related to the single topic of "expression in democracy" or "civic participation."

EMBEDVEC_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['culture', 'culture', 'sports', 'yogurt'] with connection Among the candidate words, "culture" has the strongest connection to the anchor words (culture, sports, yogurt). The common thread among the anchor words is that they all relate to different aspects of human activities and practices. 

1. Culture: This word itself is one of the anchor words and represents the broadest concept, encompassing customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or social group.

2. Sports: A significant part of many cultures, representing physical activities, competitions, and pastimes that are often deeply ingrained in societal traditions.

3. Yogurt: A food product that is closely associated with certain cultures, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and has become popular worldwide as part of health-conscious diets.

The word "culture" best captures the essence of all these concepts. It's directly related to sports as cultural activities and to yogurt as a cultural food item. None of the other candidate words (supper, heyday, city, hijinks) have such a strong and direct connection to all three anchor words simultaneously.

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['auto', 'ride', 'wheels', 'whip'] with connection vehicles or transportation
vehicles or transportation ~ car, informally: ['auto', 'ride', 'wheels', 'whip'] == ['auto', 'ride', 'wheels', 'whip']
Recommendation ['auto', 'ride', 'wheels', 'whip'] is correct

EMBEDVEC_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['beginner', 'open', 'open', 'receptive'] with connection The common connection present in all the "anchor_words" (beginner, open, receptive) is the concept of being approachable, willing to learn, and without preconceived notions. The word that best fits this connection from the candidate list is "open". Here's why:

1. "Open" is directly one of the anchor words, which makes it the strongest connection.
2. It perfectly embodies the shared concept of being receptive, approachable, and willing to learn or experience new things.
3. "Open" can describe a beginner's mindset (open to learning), and it's synonymous with being receptive.
4. None of the other candidate words capture this shared meaning as accurately or comprehensively as "open" does.

While "easy" might be somewhat related (as things might be made easy for beginners), and "live" could potentially relate to being open to experiences, "open" is by far the most directly connected and relevant choice from the candidate list.
Recommendation ['beginner', 'open', 'open', 'receptive'] is incorrect
Changing the recommender from 'embedvec_recommender' to 'llm_recommender'

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['choice', 'speak', 'voice', 'vote'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words 'speak', 'voice', and 'vote' is the concept of expressing one's opinion or preference. 'Choice' is the most highly connected word to this theme among the candidate words. It directly relates to the act of selecting or deciding, which is inherent in voting. When we speak or voice our opinions, we are often making or expressing choices. The word 'choice' embodies the fundamental concept of decision-making and self-expression that underlies all the anchor words.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 4
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('amazing', 'lit', 'solid')
Connection Description: The words "amazing," "lit," and "solid" can be related to a single topic: slang or informal language used to express approval or positive qualities.

Common contexts for each word:
1. Amazing: wonderful, impressive, astonishing
2. Lit: exciting, excellent, cool (in modern slang)
3. Solid: reliable, strong, good

The shared context for all three words is their use in informal or slang language to describe something positively. In contemporary vernacular, especially among younger generations:

- "Amazing" is commonly used to express strong approval or admiration.
- "Lit" has evolved to mean something exciting, awesome, or excellent.
- "Solid" is often used to describe something as good, reliable, or praiseworthy.

All three words can be used interchangeably in certain contexts to express that something is very good or impressive. For example, one might say "That party was amazing/lit/solid" to convey the same general meaning of a highly enjoyable event.

Therefore, these words can be related to the single topic of positive slang expressions or informal language used for approval.

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['amazing', 'lit', 'solid', 'wicked'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words "amazing", "lit", and "solid" is that they are all slang terms or informal expressions used to describe something positively or impressively. 

1. "Amazing" means extremely impressive or excellent.
2. "Lit" is slang for exciting, enjoyable, or excellent.
3. "Solid" in this context means reliable, excellent, or impressive.

Among the candidate words, "wicked" is the most highly connected to the anchor words because:

1. "Wicked" has evolved in slang usage to mean extremely good, excellent, or impressive, which aligns closely with the positive connotations of the anchor words.
2. Like "lit" and "solid", "wicked" has undergone a semantic shift in informal language from a negative meaning to a positive one.
3. "Wicked" is often used in similar contexts as the anchor words, particularly in youth culture and informal speech, to express enthusiasm or admiration.

The other candidate words either lack the strong positive connotation (e.g., "easy", "flexible", "open") or have negative or neutral meanings (e.g., "vile", "evil") that don't align with the anchor words' positive slang usage.

>>>Number of single topic groups: 3
More than one single-topic group recommendations, selecting one at random.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('city', 'culture', 'sports')
Connection Description: The three words 'city', 'culture', and 'sports' can be related to a single topic. A common context that encompasses all three words is "urban life" or "metropolitan areas". Here's how they relate:

1. City: This directly refers to an urban area or metropolis.
2. Culture: Cities are often hubs of diverse cultural activities, including arts, music, food, and festivals.
3. Sports: Many cities have professional sports teams, host major sporting events, and provide various recreational facilities for residents.

These three elements are integral parts of urban environments. Cities are known for their rich cultural scenes and sporting activities, which contribute significantly to their identity and appeal. For example, New York City is famous for its cultural diversity, Broadway shows (culture), and teams like the Yankees or Knicks (sports). Therefore, these three words can be cohesively linked under the umbrella topic of urban or city life.

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['city', 'culture', 'heyday', 'sports'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words "city," "culture," and "sports" is that they all relate to aspects of urban life and human activities that often flourish in metropolitan areas. "Heyday" is the most connected to these anchor words because it refers to a period of great success, popularity, or vigor, which can be applied to a city's golden age, a thriving culture, or a sports team's prime years. Cities often have their heyday when their culture and sports scenes are at their peak. This word captures the essence of vibrancy and success that can be associated with urban environments, cultural phenomena, and sporting achievements.

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['ball', 'chalk', 'cue', 'rack'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words "ball", "cue", and "rack" is billiards or pool. These are all essential elements in the game of pool:

1. Ball: The object that players hit and try to pocket.
2. Cue: The long stick used to strike the cue ball.
3. Rack: The triangular frame used to arrange the balls at the start of the game.

Among the candidate words, "chalk" has the highest degree of connection to the anchor words and the game of pool. Chalk is used to apply to the tip of the cue stick to increase friction and prevent miscues when striking the cue ball. It's an essential accessory in billiards and pool, directly related to the cue and indirectly to the ball and rack.

None of the other candidate words have as strong or direct a connection to the game of billiards or pool as "chalk" does.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('corn', 'egg', 'schmaltz')
Connection Description: The words 'corn', 'egg', and 'schmaltz' can be related to a single topic: cooking or culinary ingredients. Here's the reasoning:

1. Corn: A common grain used in various culinary applications, from side dishes to ingredients in recipes.
2. Egg: A versatile ingredient used in many dishes, from baking to cooking.
3. Schmaltz: A type of rendered chicken fat used in Jewish cuisine as a cooking fat or flavor enhancer.

All three words are ingredients or food items used in cooking. They could potentially be found in the same kitchen or used in related recipes, particularly in Jewish or Eastern European cuisine where schmaltz is more common. While they might not always be used together, they all fall under the broader category of culinary ingredients or cooking-related items. Therefore, a single topic that encompasses all three words could be 'culinary ingredients' or 'cooking'."

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['corn', 'egg', 'sap', 'schmaltz'] with connection The common connection among the anchor words (corn, egg, schmaltz) is that they are all related to food or cooking ingredients. 'Sap' is the most connected to this theme among the candidate words. Sap, while having multiple meanings, is a sweet fluid that can be extracted from certain plants (like maple trees) and used as a food ingredient or flavoring, similar to how corn, eggs, and schmaltz (rendered poultry fat) are used in cooking. This culinary connection makes 'sap' the most closely related to the anchor words.
