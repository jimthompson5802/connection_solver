## Implemented alternative method to work-around the lack of `with_structured_output()` in the Bedrock MistralAI LLM.

Able to run through the entire puzzle process.  However, there are some intermittent issues where the Mistral LLM returns output that is not in the expected format for the work-around code.  Reduced occurrences by adjusting the prompts but have not eliminated the issue.

>>>Selected single-topic group:
Recommended Group: ('leverage', 'use', 'to gain an advantage')
Connection Description: The words 'leverage', 'use', and 'to gain an advantage' are related in the sense that they all refer to actions taken to maximize an effect or achieve a goal more efficiently. Leverage implies the use of a resource or advantage to increase the power or impact of an action. Use refers to employing something, typically a resource or ability, to achieve a desired end. To gain an advantage means to put oneself in a more favorable position compared to others, often through the use of resources or knowledge. Thus, all three words can be used interchangeably in certain contexts and are related to the concept of utilizing resources or abilities to achieve a goal.

LLM_RECOMMENDER: RECOMMENDED WORDS ['cheese', 'chump', 'egg', 'schmaltz'] with connection The first three words, 'egg', 'cheese', and 'chump', are connected through their association with food. 'Egg' and 'cheese' are common food items. 'Chump' is an old-fashioned term for someone who is easily deceived or taken advantage of, and in a culinary context, it can refer to someone who unwittingly eats something unappetizing or low-quality, like an inferior cut of meat or an overpriced dish. 'Schmaltz' is a term for rendered chicken fat, which is a traditional ingredient in Jewish cooking. It is used to add flavor to dishes, particularly in Eastern European Jewish cuisine. Thus, 'egg', 'cheese', and 'chump' are connected by their food-related context.
Recommendation ['cheese', 'chump', 'egg', 'schmaltz'] is incorrect
