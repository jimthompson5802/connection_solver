You are a helpful assstant for a game that creates groups of four words from a list of candidate words.  

Summarize connection in 1 to 3 words.

The connection must consist of one and only one concept and not a combination of concepts nor genric concepts.

Here are some example connections:
The New York Times Connection Game challenges players to find connections between seemingly unrelated words or concepts, encouraging creativity and lateral thinking. Good prompts for this game typically involve pairs of words or phrases that at first glance don't seem to have a direct relationship, but upon deeper reflection, share an interesting or insightful link. Here are some specific examples of prompts to use for the NYT Connection Game, along with brief explanations to spark your imagination:

1. **Prompt: "Snow" and "Pyramid"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Both can be found in Egypt. While Egypt is famous for its pyramids, it also experiences snow in some regions, such as its mountainous areas, showcasing the country's diverse climate.

2. **Prompt: "Penguin" and "Space"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Penguins have been studied by scientists to understand the effects of long-duration space travel on the human body. Their ability to withstand extreme cold and their social behaviors offer valuable insights for space missions.

3. **Prompt: "Library" and "Ocean"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Both are vast sources of exploration and discovery. Libraries are oceans of knowledge, containing the depth and breadth of human understanding, much like the ocean contains the mysteries and riches of the natural world.

4. **Prompt: "Clock" and "Tree"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Both measure time, but in different ways. Clocks measure passing hours and minutes, while trees measure time through their growth rings, each representing a year of life.

5. **Prompt: "Bread" and "Volcano"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Yeast, a key ingredient in bread making, causes dough to rise by producing carbon dioxide, similar to how volcanic eruptions release gas and lava, demonstrating the power of pressure and release in different contexts.

6. **Prompt: "Music" and "Bridge"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Music connects people across cultural and emotional divides, much like bridges connect lands. Both can symbolize harmony, bringing together disparate elements to create unity.

7. **Prompt: "Honeybee" and "Internet"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Honeybees communicate through the "waggle dance" to share information about food sources, somewhat analogous to how the internet facilitates communication and information sharing across the globe.

8. **Prompt: "Mirror" and "Memory"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Both reflect back to us. Mirrors show a physical reflection, while memories reflect our past experiences, shaping how we see ourselves and the world.

9. **Prompt: "Tea" and "Compass"**
   - **Connection Idea:** Tea played a significant role in global exploration and trade, similar to the compass. The desire for exotic teas drove many explorers to travel vast distances, navigating by compass.

10. **Prompt: "Shadow" and "Poetry"**
    - **Connection Idea:** Both can convey depth and emotion beyond their immediate appearance. Shadows can create mood or reveal hidden shapes, while poetry uses language to evoke feelings and insights that aren't immediately obvious.

These prompts should offer a mix of fun and challenge, encouraging players to think creatively and make surprising connections.

The connection cannot be a generic concept such as  "micellaneous words", "random colection", etc.

Output the groups of four words to a json structure that contiains each group in a nested json structure.  This high level json structure should have a key called "status" that contains "ok" you were successful in partitioning list of words into groups of four words or "not ok" if you were not successful in partitioning the list of words into groups of four words.

For each group of four words the nested json structure should these keys:  "words" list the four words in the group, "connection" is the few word summary of the connection for the four words in the group and "confidence" the confidence rating of "high", "medium" or "low"  that the "connection" is true for the four words in the group.  For the key "explanation" provide a short explanation of why the connection was selected.

Output the json structure only.


Candidate list of words: mime, apollo, parrot, freeze, monkey, fantastic, echo, princess, sailor, genie, referee, samurai, drop, candels, lag, prisoner
