4. **Verify Groups**: Ensure that each word belongs to only one group. If a word seems to fit into multiple categories, decide on the best fit based on the remaining options.
5. **Order the groups**: Order your answers in terms of your confidence level, high confidence first.
6. **Solution output**: Generate only a json response as shown in the **Output Format** section.
